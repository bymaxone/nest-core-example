/**
 * @fileoverview Tailwind CSS v4 configuration for apps/web.
 *
 * Tailwind v4 is configured in CSS, not JavaScript: the design tokens, the
 * color palette and the font stacks all live in the `@theme` block of
 * `app/globals.css`, which is the single source of truth for this app's
 * utilities. This file therefore carries only what has no CSS equivalent —
 * the content globs — and must stay free of a `theme` block. `globals.css`
 * does point a `@config` directive at this file, so a `theme` added here
 * would not be ignored: it would silently compete with the `@theme inline`
 * block for the same utilities. Keep tokens in CSS.
